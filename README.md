## 🎯 What is Wazuh MCP Server?

Wazuh MCP Server bridges the gap between traditional SIEM operations and conversational AI, enabling security teams to interact with their Wazuh infrastructure using natural language through Claude Desktop. This isn't just another integration - it's a paradigm shift in how security operations are conducted.

### 🤔 Why Should You Care?

- **🚀 10x Faster Incident Response**: Query your security data conversationally instead of writing complex queries
- **🧠 AI-Enhanced Analysis**: Leverage Claude's reasoning capabilities for threat analysis and correlation
- **🔄 Automated Workflows**: Convert natural language requests into complex security operations
- **📊 Real-time Intelligence**: Get instant insights from multiple threat intelligence sources
- **🎓 Lower Learning Curve**: New team members can be productive immediately without learning query languages

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🔍 Advanced Threat Detection & Analysis

- **Multi-dimensional Risk Scoring**: Combines alert severity, frequency, vulnerability data, and behavioral patterns
- **ML-based Anomaly Detection**: Statistical analysis with configurable sensitivity levels
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**: Automatic TTP identification and kill chain analysis
- **Threat Correlation Engine**: Cross-references alerts with external threat intelligence

### 🤖 Natural Language Security Operations

Ask Claude questions like:
- *"Are we under attack right now?"*
- *"Show me all privilege escalation attempts in the last 48 hours"*
- *"Which systems have critical vulnerabilities that are being actively exploited?"*
- *"Generate an executive report on our security posture"*

### 📋 Compliance Automation

- **Multi-Framework Support**: PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, NIST, ISO 27001
- **Automated Gap Analysis**: Identifies missing controls and generates remediation plans
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time compliance scoring with trend analysis
- **Audit-Ready Reports**: Generate compliance evidence with a single command

### 🌐 Threat Intelligence Integration

- **VirusTotal**: File hash reputation and malware analysis
- **Shodan**: Internet-wide scan data and exposure assessment
- **AbuseIPDB**: IP reputation and abuse history
- **Custom Feeds**: Extensible architecture for additional threat feeds

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **MCP Protocol Handler**: Implements the Model Context Protocol for Claude Desktop communication
2. **Async API Client**: High-performance, non-blocking Wazuh API interactions
3. **Analysis Engine**: Advanced security algorithms for threat detection and risk assessment
4. **Intelligence Aggregator**: Consolidates data from multiple threat intelligence sources
5. **Compliance Framework**: Modular compliance checking and reporting system

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ 
- Wazuh 4.x deployment
- Claude Desktop application

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and enter directory
git clone https://github.com/gensecaihq/wazuh-mcp-server.git
