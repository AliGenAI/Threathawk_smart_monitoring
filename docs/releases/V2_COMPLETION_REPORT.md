## 🏗️ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Factory Pattern Implementation
```
ToolFactory
├── StatisticsTools (4 tools)
├── VulnerabilityTools (2 tools)  
├── AgentTools (2 tools)
└── ClusterTools (4 tools)
```

### Phase 5 Enhancement Pipeline
```
ContextAggregator
├── Pipelines (specialized context gathering)
├── Cache (intelligent caching with TTL)
├── Adapters (data quality assessment)
└── Updates (real-time monitoring)
```

### Integration Flow
```
main.py → ToolFactory.is_tool_available() → ToolFactory.handle_tool_call() 
       → BaseTool.handle_tool_call() → Specific tool handler
       → ContextAggregator.enhance_response() → Enhanced output
```
